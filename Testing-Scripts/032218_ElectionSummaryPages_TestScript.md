## Introduction script:
Hi, I'm ___, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website, and we'd like to get some quick feedback on new features we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here and all your answers will be the right ones. Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.
Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us. Sound good?
[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

### Election summary race pages 
Tested on feature: https://fec-feature-cms.app.cloud.gov/data/elections/house/AZ/01/2016/

Orienting scenario: You’re doing research on the 2016 Arizona district 1 election. And you’ve come to this page to learn more about this election.  *Prompt them to go back to these election summary pages if they navigate away.* 

1. Wendy Rogers was a candidate in this election. Where would you look to see the date of the last report filed by Wendy Rogers’ committee?
2. When was her committee supposed to file their pre-primary report?
3. Where would you go to find out about outside spending in this election?
4. The DCCC spent more than $2 million on independent expenditures. Can you tell me when they were required to report those expenditures? 
5. Can you tell me if money was spent on electioneering communications for this election?
6. If you wanted to double check if a particular candidate is on the ballot, where would you look to find state contact information? 
7. Let’s say you want to check when these candidates need to file all their reports. How would you do that?
8. Can you tell me which candidate is raising the most money in the current election for this district?
9. What is your overall impression of these pages?

## Closing questions:
1. Any last thoughts about the features you looked at today?
2. Any other general feedback you’d like to provide, or any questions for me?
3. Not a question: Mention feedback button/github.
