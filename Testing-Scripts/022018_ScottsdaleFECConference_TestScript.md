## Introduction script:
*Start by asking how much time they have. That will help gauge how many mini-tests you can conduct. It will also reflect well on us, having taken the time to ask and respecting their time.

Hi, I'm ___, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get some quick feedback on new features and content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here and all your answers will be the right ones. Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.
Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us. Sound good?
[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

4. How much did the DCCC spend in this race?
5. Can you tell me when the DCCC was required to report those expenditures?
6. Can you tell me when the 2016 primary election was held in this district?
7. If you wanted to double check if a particular candidate is on the ballot, where would you go for that information?
