## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We are currently in the early stages of redesigning the home page for the FEC website, so we won’t be showing you a real, live webpage today. Instead, we’re going to look at some really basic designs that we call a “wireframe.”

We like to talk with people like you at this stage in our process so that we can identify possible problems early on, before we’ve gone to the trouble of stylizing and developing everything.

It might be helpful to think of a wireframe like blueprints for a house: It is a “skeleton” of a webpage. The wireframe will be black and white, and it won’t contain a lot of detail. There will be nothing to click on, and nothing will be interactive.  Essentially, we’re just starting to sketch out the basics of how the homepage could work and what kinds of information it could contain.

Is this all making sense so far?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

Okay, before we look at the wireframe, I also want to make it clear that we're testing the design, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the design. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframe, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What brought you to the FEC website when you visited last?
	- What is your background?
- When you’re coming to a website like the FEC’s, what do you typically expect from the homepage?

## Questions:

Okay, now let’s look at the  design. Let's try having you open the PDF and share your screen with me.

[user opens PDF and shares screen]

- Staying scrolled to the top of the screen, what is your first impression of the page?

[Tell user that they can now feel free to scroll as needed for the rest of the session. Remind them to please think out loud as they answer questions.]

- You mentioned that when you last visited the FEC website, you were trying to [repeat task]. How, if at all, would you go about doing that with what you see here?

- Imagine that you don't know anything about the FEC and you came to this website because you wanted to improve your understanding. With that perspective in mind, what thoughts do you have about the homepage?

- _if not already addressed_ What do you think of the section titled "Commissioners of the FEC"?

- Imagine that you recently heard about a court case involving the FEC, and you came here to see if the FEC said anything about it. What would you do?

- What do you think of the information in the "What's Happening" section?

- If you worked for a candidate's campaign and you came here seeking information and guidance from the FEC that could help you in your work, what would would you do?

- What thoughts do you have about the financial data section?

-  Let's scroll back to the top. As you may know, the FEC deals with campaign finance for federal elections, and it does not oversee state-level campaigns. However, people often make the mistake of asking the FEC about state-level issues. If you came to the FEC website with a state-level question, what would be your expectations?
    - Would the information on this page be helpful to you?

- Thinking about the page as a whole, does it seem like there is anything missing?

- Is there anything you would change about this design?

   - If you had a magic wand and could make this page do anything you wanted, is there something special you would make it would do?

- Does this homepage design help you to understand the kinds of things you can do on the FEC website?

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share about the design, or any questions for me?
